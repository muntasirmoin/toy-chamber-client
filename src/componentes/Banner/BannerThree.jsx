It usually features wheels, a body, and sometimes additional details like doors, windows, and interiors. Toy cars can be made from various materials such as plastic, metal, or wood, and they come in different sizes, colors, and designs. Children often enjoy pushing or rolling toy cars around, creating imaginative play scenarios, and simulating driving experiences.</p>
